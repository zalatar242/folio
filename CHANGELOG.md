# Changelog

All notable changes to Folio will be documented in this file.

## [0.2.9.0] - 2026-04-05

### Changed
- AI optimization endpoint now fetches price, volatility, and treasury balance in parallel (~3x faster)
- Replaced multi-step agentic LLM pre-flight with direct Hedera SDK balance check (5-10s down to ~200ms)
- All 3 collar durations (1/2/3 months) computed in a single API call, enabling instant duration switching
- Added 5-minute AI recommendation cache keyed by symbol to skip redundant LLM calls
- Renamed "Your Protection" to "Price Range" on spend page for clearer neobank framing
- Confirmation page now shows floor/cap prices inline in the advance summary
- AI analysis on confirmation page moved to a collapsible section showing actual reasoning instead of generic text
- SpendResult type extended with floor, cap, floorPct, capPct fields

## [0.2.8.0] - 2026-04-05

### Changed
- Chainlink is now the primary price source with a 3-tier fallback: Chainlink Price Feed, CRE CollarOracle, Yahoo Finance, then hardcoded
- Added direct Chainlink Price Feed reads via `getLatestPrice` on the CollarOracle contract, independent of the CRE workflow
- Tightened staleness window from 1 hour to 10 minutes for CRE data and 5 minutes for direct price feeds, matching the CRE cron schedule
- Price data now includes collar parameters (floor/cap/volatility) when available from the Chainlink oracle
- Chainlink prices now track change/changePercent across fetches instead of always returning zero
- Frontend PriceData type updated to include `chainlink` source and optional collar fields

## [0.2.7.0] - 2026-04-05

### Added
- Hedera Agent Kit integration with MiniMax M1 for autonomous on-chain operations (AI & Agentic Payments bounty)
- AI agent endpoint (`/api/ai/agent`) supporting freeform prompts and structured actions (balance checks, audit logs, collar analysis)
- Agentic pre-flight in collar optimization: AI agent verifies treasury USDC balance before recommending advances
- Folio logo as SVG favicon replacing default Next.js icon

### Fixed
- Mirror node transaction ID normalization only replaces timestamp dot, not account ID dots
- Auth demo bypass gated to non-production environments (was active in all environments)
- USDC rounding in escrow uses `Math.round` instead of `Math.floor` to prevent off-by-one losses
- Chainlink route now requires authentication (was previously unprotected)
- Users can only access/modify their own encryption keys via ownership checks
- Card freeze endpoint scoped to authenticated user's notes (was querying all notes)
- parseInt calls include radix and NaN fallback across audit, transactions, and notes routes
- Error responses return proper 500 status codes instead of 200 with error body
- Note ID validation rejects non-numeric IDs with 400 instead of passing NaN
- SpendFlow amount input prevents multiple decimal points
- `selectedNoteId` falsy check changed to `!== null` so noteId 0 works correctly
- Per-symbol price cache prevents stale data when fetching different stock symbols

### Changed
