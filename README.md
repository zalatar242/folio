## The Problem

Americans have $30 trillion in brokerage accounts they can't spend. If you need cash, you either:

1. **Sell your shares** — lose 20-37% to capital gains taxes, permanently exit your position
2. **Take a margin loan** — pay 7-12% interest, risk margin calls and liquidation, need $500K+ at most brokerages

Both options are terrible for a 28-year-old with $40K in Tesla who needs $500 for a dental bill.

## What Folio Does

**Folio gives you a 0% loan against your stock portfolio so you can spend your investments without selling them.**

- **0% interest, always** — no spread, no hidden fees
- **No minimums** — borrow against $100 or $100,000 in stocks
- **No liquidation risk** — mathematically impossible, your downside is bounded
- **No selling, no taxes** — your shares stay yours

The only trade-off: your upside is temporarily capped while the loan is open (typically ~115% for 30 days). For someone spending $50 on groceries, that's invisible.

## How It Works (for judges)

When you spend $50 against $225 TSLA:

1. Folio locks ~0.222 TSLA shares as collateral
2. A protection range is set: floor at $213.75 (downside protected), ceiling at $258.75 (upside limited)
3. You receive $50 USDC at 0% interest
4. At expiry, repay $50 and get your shares back — or the shares settle the balance automatically

The financial structure that makes 0% possible: a zero-cost options hedge that offsets borrowing cost by temporarily limiting upside. The premium from selling the upside pays for the downside protection. Net cost to the user: $0.

## The Market

Fidelity, Schwab, and Morgan Stanley all offer securities-backed lines of credit (SBLOCs). Every single one requires $500K+ in assets and charges 7-9% interest. Folio does the same thing for anyone, at 0%, from their phone.
